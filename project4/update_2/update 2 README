### Update 2 

The game dataset will be retrieved from a website that contains all the statistics and in order to do that we need to import some packages for example the panda library 
import pandas as pd. After that we will call out the functions to reterieve the data from csv file. 

player_data_df = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
season_stats_df = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
avg_minutes_per_game = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
true_shooting = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
3_point_attempt_rate = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
