### Update 2 

The game dataset will be retrieved from a website that contains all the statistics and in order to do that we need to import some packages for example the panda library 
import pandas as pd
player_data_df = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
season_stats_df = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
avg_minutes_per_game = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
true_shooting = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
3_point_attempt_rate = pd.read_csv('FILENAME')
