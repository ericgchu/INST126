# Project 2: Hangman 

## Summary
This is a fun hangman game with a twist... You have to guess the encrypted word to discover the decrypted word.

## How It Works 
Before the program asks you to enter a letter to guess, it will display the amount of lives you have left, letters you've guessed and a visual representation of letters you've guessed out of the word you are trying to guess.<br/> 
Enter a number for the operation you want to complete.<br/> 
Enter the numbers you would like to operate on.<br/>
Your result will be printed for you!<br/>
